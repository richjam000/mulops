NAME
     mulops - Multi Operating System tool
              Simple consistent commands..

AUTHOR
     Richard.Jamieson@scsuk.net

DESCRIPTION
     Different operating systems have different ways of doing the same thing.
     ( eg: showing total amount of system memory ).
     This tool aims to help to provide a consistent way to do the same things
     across multiple operating systems.
     The tool can be used for one-off commands, to create portable system
     programs, or just for education

CONFIGURATION
     MULOPS-COMMANDS:
     To add new commands to mulops simply create yourself a new catalog.
     Follow the pattern of the examples, provided with the product.
     Example catalog shown below.
     Default directory for the catalogs directory is "catalogs".
     If you dont want to use the default directory you can specify the catalog
     space separated ) names via the MULOPS_CATALOGS variable. 
     Catalog names can be specified as 
               a) full PATH-name of the catalog
     and/or:   b) URL of a catalog  ( eg: http://www.mulops.com/catalogs/mulcat.default.json ).

     If you think your new catalog entries will be of use to others please
     let me know and I will add then to the default catalog, or make them
     available at http://www.mulops.com/catalogs.

     MULOPS-GROUPS
     MULOPS-GROUPS are groups of MULOPS-COMMANDS.
     Using groups allows you run mulops across groups of commands.
     Groups can be specified using the "-g" flag ( see "mulops usage.doc" )
     Groups are configured using the "mulgroup.default.json" file residing in the
     "catalogs" directory.

JSON for MULOPS-COMMANDS ( AKA the CATALOGS )
     Some catalogs are supplied with the release - see the "catalogs" directory.
     Catalogs can also be sourced via http - eg: see http://www.mulops.com/catalogs

JSON for MULOPS-GROUPS
     Example of groups configuration:

        }
     }



SUPPORT DOCS
     Some support-docs are supplied with the release - see the "docs" directory.
     mulops catalog entries should be set-up to allow easy viewing of the docs,
     eg "mulops readme" will display suport doc "mulops.README.doc".
     Default directory for the docs directory is "docs".
     If you think any new documents that you create will be of use to others please
     let me know and I will add them to the release, or make them
     available at http://www.mulops.com/docs

SUPPORT SCRIPTS
     Sometimes it make be impractical/impossible to code operating-system commands you wish 
     add to the mulops catalog in a one liner - in which case you will need to create a 
     "support script" and configure mulops to run that script instead.
     Mulops will allow you to write and call a separate script for each os/osversion, but still
     call the script in the same way on each os/osversion.
     Two support scripts are supplied with the product "linux.distro" and "linux.version".
     default directory for support-scripts is "bin".
     
	
MODELS
     "models" allow you to simulate different environments to see what commands mulops would
     run in those environments.
     "models" are defined in in model-files contained the the "models" directory.
     Some default model-files are supplied - but you can create you own
     If you think any new models that you create will be of use to others please
     let me know and I will add them to the release, or make them
     available at http://www.mulops.com/models

     Sample model file:	model.windows10.json

     {
      	"baseostype": {
        	"execute":       "Windows"
   	},
   	"distro": {
        	"execute":       "Microsoft"
   	},
   	"ostype": {
        	"execute":       "Microsoft Windows 10"
   	},
   	"osversion": {
        	"execute":       "10.0.10586"
   	}
     }
